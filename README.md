#Node.js addon for Aquastream XT
##Introduction

This is a native Node.js addon for communicating with the Aquastream XT device.

Currently it is *read-only*, so you cannot send any USB feature reports to the device yet.

##Usage
See [node-aquastreamxt](https://github.com/adick/node-aquastreamxt) for a usage example.
